Question: A class has 32 students and they all need to present their projects. Every period is 40 minutes long. How many periods will it take for every student to present their project if they have 5 minutes to do so?

Answer: There are 32 students and each student needs 5 minutes to present their project.
So the total time needed is 32 x 5 = 160 minutes.
There are 40 minutes in each period.
So the number of periods needed is 160/40 = 4.
So, the final answer is 4.


Question: A bag contains 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards. There are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards. If there are 200 hockey cards in the bag, how many cards are there altogether?

Answer: There are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards, so there are 4 x 200 = 800 football cards.
There are 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards, so there are 800 - 50 = 750 baseball cards.
There are 200 hockey cards, 800 football cards and 750 baseball cards for a total of 200 + 800 + 750 = 1750 cards.
So, the final answer is 1750.


Question: A bag of caramel cookies has 20 cookies inside and a box of cookies has 4 bags in total. How many calories are inside the box if each cookie is 20 calories?

Answer: There are 20 cookies in each bag and 4 bags in total. 
So there are 20 x 4 = 80 cookies in total.
Each cookie is 20 calories, so the total calories are 80 x 20 = 1600 calories.
So, the final answer is 1600.


Question: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?

Answer: Each member consumes 3+2 = 5 slices of bread per day.
There are 4 members so they consume 5 x 4 = 20 slices of bread per day.
Each loaf has 12 slices so 5 loaves have 5 x 12 = 60 slices.
60 slices of bread will last 60/20 = 3 days.
So, the final answer is 3.


Question: Bill decides to bring donuts to work for a meeting that day. He buys a box of donuts that has 50 in total in them. He eats 2 on the ride in because he's hungry. When he gets to the office, the secretary takes another 4 out of the box when he's not looking. Lastly, right before the meeting Bill sets the box down on his desk and leaves the office to take a phone call. While Bill's away, his coworkers steal half the remaining donuts. Bill comes back and brings the box into his meeting. How many donuts are left in the box?

Answer: Bill eats 2 donuts on the ride in, leaving 50 - 2 = 48 donuts.
The secretary eats 4 donuts, leaving 48 - 4 = 44 donuts.
Bill's coworkers eat half of the remaining donuts, which is 44/2 = 22 donuts.
So Bill has 44 - 22 = 22 donuts left.
So, the final answer is 22.


Question: Boris has 100 pieces of Halloween candy. His daughter eats 8 pieces of candy. He separates the remaining pieces of candy into equal portions into 4 different bowls. Then he takes away 3 pieces of candy from each bowl to keep for himself. How many pieces of candy are in one bowl?

Answer: Boris has 100 - 8 = 92 pieces of candy left.
He divides the 92 pieces of candy into 4 bowls. 92/4 = 23 pieces of candy in each bowl.
Then he takes away 3 pieces of candy from each bowl. 23 - 3 = 20 pieces of candy in each bowl.
So, the final answer is 20.


Question: Yvonne and Janna were writing their 1000-word pair research paper. Yvonne was able to write 400 words while Janna wrote 150 more words than Yvonne. When they edited their paper, they removed 20 words and added twice as many words as they removed. How many more words should they add to reach the research paper requirement?

Answer: Yvonne wrote 400 words and Janna wrote 150 more words than Yvonne, so Janna wrote 400 + 150 = 550 words.
Together they wrote 400 + 550 = 950 words.
After editing, they removed 20 words and added 2 x 20 = 40 words. So they have 950 - 20 + 40 = 970 words.
They need 1000 words, so they need 1000 - 970 = 30 more words.
So, the final answer is 30.


Question: Luke started working on a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. The first day he worked on it, he put together 10 percent of the pieces. On the second day, he put together another 20 percent of the remaining pieces from the first day. On the third day, he put together 30 percent of the remaining pieces from the previous day. How many pieces does he have left to complete after the third day?

Answer: 10 percent of 1000 is 100.
So he has 100 pieces done after the first day.
He has 900 pieces left.
20 percent of 900 is 180.
So he has 100 + 180 = 280 pieces done after the second day.
He has 720 pieces left.
30 percent of 720 is 216.
So he has 280 + 216 = 496 pieces done after the third day.
He has 720 - 216 = 504 pieces left.
So, the final answer is 504.""",

"gsm8k_explicit_examples": """Below you will find some questions followed by a wrong answer, a rationale and the correct answer.


Question: A class has 32 students and they all need to present their projects. Every period is 40 minutes long. How many periods will it take for every student to present their project if they have 5 minutes to do so?

Wrong answer: 32 students x 5 minutes = 160 minutes.
5 minutes x 40 minutes = 200 minutes.
160 minutes + 200 minutes = 360 minutes.
So it will take 360 minutes or 6 hours for every student to present their project.
So, the final answer is 360.

Rationale: The error occurs in the second line of the wrong answer. The calculation of 5 minutes x 40 minutes = 200 minutes is incorrect and irrelevant to the problem. The correct approach is to calculate the total time needed for all presentations (32 students x 5 minutes each = 160 minutes) and then divide this by the length of each period (40 minutes) to find the number of periods needed. The incorrect answer also incorrectly converts the total minutes into hours, which is not asked for in the question.

Correct answer: There are 32 students and each student needs 5 minutes to present their project.
So the total time needed is 32 x 5 = 160 minutes.
There are 40 minutes in each period.
So the number of periods needed is 160/40 = 4.
So, the final answer is 4.


Question: A bag contains 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards. There are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards. If there are 200 hockey cards in the bag, how many cards are there altogether?

Wrong answer: 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards.
There are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards.
If there are 200 hockey cards in the bag, there are 200 x 4 = 800 football cards and 800 - 50 = 750 baseball cards.
So there are 750 + 800 = 1550 cards altogether.
So, the final answer is 1550.

Rationale: The error occurs in the last line of the wrong answer. The wrong answer incorrectly calculates the total number of cards. The total number of cards should be the sum of the hockey cards, football cards, and baseball cards. The correct calculation is 200 (hockey cards) + 800 (football cards) + 750 (baseball cards) = 1750 cards.

Correct answer: There are 4 times as many football cards as hockey cards, so there are 4 x 200 = 800 football cards.
There are 50 fewer baseball cards than football cards, so there are 800 - 50 = 750 baseball cards.
There are 200 hockey cards, 800 football cards and 750 baseball cards for a total of 200 + 800 + 750 = 1750 cards.
So, the final answer is 1750.


Question: A bag of caramel cookies has 20 cookies inside and a box of cookies has 4 bags in total. How many calories are inside the box if each cookie is 20 calories?

Wrong answer: 20 cookies in a bag amount to 20 x 20 = 400 calories.
There are 4 bags in a box.
So 400/4 = 100 calories in a box.
So, the final answer is 100.

Rationale: The error occurs in line 3 of the wrong answer. The incorrect part of this line is the calculation of the total calories in a box. The total calories should be calculated by multiplying the total number of cookies in the box (which is 80, not 20) by the calories per cookie. The wrong answer incorrectly divided the total calories in a bag by the number of bags in a box.

Correct answer: There are 20 cookies in each bag and 4 bags in total. 
So there are 20 x 4 = 80 cookies in total.
Each cookie is 20 calories, so the total calories are 80 x 20 = 1600 calories.
So, the final answer is 1600.


Question: There are four members in one household. Each member consumes 3 slices of bread during breakfast and 2 slices of bread for snacks. A loaf of bread has 12 slices. How many days will five loaves of bread last in this family?

Wrong answer: 12/4 = 3 slices of bread per person per day.
5 loaves of bread = 5 x 12 = 60 slices of bread.
60/4 = 15 days.
So, the final answer is 15.

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The incorrect part of this line is the calculation of the slices of bread consumed per person per day. The problem states that each member consumes 3 slices of bread for breakfast and 2 slices for snacks, so each member consumes a total of 5 slices per day, not 3. Therefore, the total slices of bread consumed per day by the family should be 5 slices per person * 4 people = 20 slices, not 12. The correct calculation should then be 60 slices / 20 slices per day = 3 days.

Correct answer: Each member consumes 3+2 = 5 slices of bread per day.
There are 4 members so they consume 5 x 4 = 20 slices of bread per day.
Each loaf has 12 slices so 5 loaves have 5 x 12 = 60 slices.
60 slices of bread will last 60/20 = 3 days.
So, the final answer is 3.


Question: Bill decides to bring donuts to work for a meeting that day. He buys a box of donuts that has 50 in total in them. He eats 2 on the ride in because he's hungry. When he gets to the office, the secretary takes another 4 out of the box when he's not looking. Lastly, right before the meeting Bill sets the box down on his desk and leaves the office to take a phone call. While Bill's away, his coworkers steal half the remaining donuts. Bill comes back and brings the box into his meeting. How many donuts are left in the box?

Wrong answer: Bill eats 2 donuts on the way to work.
The secretary takes 4 donuts.
Bill's coworkers steal 25 donuts.
Bill brings the box into the meeting with 23 donuts.
So, the final answer is 23.

Rationale: The error occurs in line 2 of the wrong answer. The incorrect part of this line is the calculation of the number of donuts stolen by Bill's coworkers. The problem states that his coworkers steal half of the remaining donuts, not half of the original number of donuts. Therefore, the number of donuts stolen by his coworkers should be half of the remaining 44 donuts, not half of the original 50 donuts.

Correct answer: Bill eats 2 donuts on the ride in, leaving 50 - 2 = 48 donuts.
The secretary eats 4 donuts, leaving 48 - 4 = 44 donuts.
Bill's coworkers eat half of the remaining donuts, which is 44/2 = 22 donuts.
So Bill has 44 - 22 = 22 donuts left.
So, the final answer is 22.


Question: Boris has 100 pieces of Halloween candy. His daughter eats 8 pieces of candy. He separates the remaining pieces of candy into equal portions into 4 different bowls. Then he takes away 3 pieces of candy from each bowl to keep for himself. How many pieces of candy are in one bowl?

Wrong answer: Boris has 100 pieces of candy.
His daughter eats 8 pieces of candy.
He separates the remaining pieces of candy into equal portions into 4 different bowls.
Then he takes away 3 pieces of candy from each bowl to keep for himself. So he has 100-8 = 92 pieces of candy in 4 bowls.
He takes away 3 pieces of candy from each bowl. So he has 92-3 = 89 pieces of candy in 4 bowls.
So, the final answer is 89.

Rationale: The error occurs at line 5 of the wrong answer. The incorrect part of this line is the calculation of the number of candies left after Boris takes away 3 pieces from each bowl. The subtraction should be done after dividing the total number of candies by 4 (the number of bowls), not before. Also, the subtraction should be 3*4=12, not just 3, because Boris takes away 3 pieces from each of the 4 bowls.

Correct answer: Boris has 100 - 8 = 92 pieces of candy left.
He divides the 92 pieces of candy into 4 bowls. 92/4 = 23 pieces of candy in each bowl.
Then he takes away 3 pieces of candy from each bowl. 23 - 3 = 20 pieces of candy in each bowl.
So, the final answer is 20.


Question: Yvonne and Janna were writing their 1000-word pair research paper. Yvonne was able to write 400 words while Janna wrote 150 more words than Yvonne. When they edited their paper, they removed 20 words and added twice as many words as they removed. How many more words should they add to reach the research paper requirement?

Wrong answer: Yvonne wrote 400 words and Janna wrote 150 more words than Yvonne. So Janna wrote 550 words.
They removed 20 words and added twice as many words as they removed. So they added 40 words.
They need to add 40 words to reach the research paper requirement.
So, the final answer is 40.

Rationale: The error occurs in line 3 of the wrong answer. The incorrect part of this line is the calculation of the total words they have after editing. They should subtract the words they removed and add the words they added to the total words they initially wrote. The wrong answer also incorrectly calculated the number of words they need to add to reach the research paper requirement. They should subtract the total words they have after editing from the research paper requirement.

Correct answer: Yvonne wrote 400 words and Janna wrote 150 more words than Yvonne, so Janna wrote 400 + 150 = 550 words.
Together they wrote 400 + 550 = 950 words.
After editing, they removed 20 words and added 2 x 20 = 40 words. So they have 950 - 20 + 40 = 970 words.
They need 1000 words, so they need 1000 - 970 = 30 more words.
So, the final answer is 30.


Question: Luke started working on a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. The first day he worked on it, he put together 10 percent of the pieces. On the second day, he put together another 20 percent of the remaining pieces from the first day. On the third day, he put together 30 percent of the remaining pieces from the previous day. How many pieces does he have left to complete after the third day?

Wrong answer: 1000 pieces = 1000/100 = 10 pieces Luke put together 10 pieces on the first day.
He put together 20 pieces on the second day.
He put together 30 pieces on the third day.
So he has 10+20+30 = 60 pieces left to complete after the third day.
So, the final answer is 60.

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The wrong answer incorrectly calculates 10 percent of 1000 as 10 pieces, when it should be 100 pieces. The same mistake is made for the calculations on the second and third day. The correct way to solve this problem is to calculate the percentage of the remaining pieces each day, not a percentage of the original 1000 pieces.

Correct answer: 10 percent of 1000 is 100.
So he has 100 pieces done after the first day.
He has 900 pieces left.
20 percent of 900 is 180.
So he has 100 + 180 = 280 pieces done after the second day.
He has 720 pieces left.
30 percent of 720 is 216.
So he has 280 + 216 = 496 pieces done after the third day.
He has 720 - 216 = 504 pieces left.
So, the final answer is 504.""",

Together they wrote 400 + 550 = 950 words.
After editing, they removed 20 words and added 2 x 20 = 40 words. So they have 950 - 20 + 40 = 970 words.
They need 1000 words, so they need 1000 - 970 = 30 more words.
So, the final answer is 30.


Question: Luke started working on a 1000-piece jigsaw puzzle. The first day he worked on it, he put together 10 percent of the pieces. On the second day, he put together another 20 percent of the remaining pieces from the first day. On the third day, he put together 30 percent of the remaining pieces from the previous day. How many pieces does he have left to complete after the third day?

Answer: 10 percent of 1000 is 100.
So he has 100 pieces done after the first day.
He has 900 pieces left.
20 percent of 900 is 180.
So he has 100 + 180 = 280 pieces done after the second day.
He has 720 pieces left.
30 percent of 720 is 216.
So he has 280 + 216 = 496 pieces done after the third day.
He has 720 - 216 = 504 pieces left.
So, the final answer is 504.


Question: Briar is attending a one-week community empowerment event and has to take a cab ride to the event and back home every day. A cab ride costs $2.5 per mile. If the event is 200 miles away from Briar's home, calculate the total amount of money the cab rides cost would be at the end of the event?

Answer: Briar has to take a cab ride to the event and back home every day. So he takes 2 cab rides per day. The distance is 200 miles and the cost per mile is $2.5. So the cost per day is 2 x 200 x 2.5 = 1000 dollars.
For 7 days, the total cost is 7 x 1000 = 7000 dollars.
So, the final answer is 7000.


Question: Because of the migration of salmon, the total number of salmon in river Trout has increased by ten times the number initially in the river. If there were 500 salmons initially, calculate the total number of fish in the river now.

Answer: There were 500 salmons initially.
The number of salmons increased by 10 times the initial number, so the number of salmons increased by 500 x 10 = 5000.
The total number of salmons now is 500 + 5000 = 5500.
So, the final answer is 5500.

Answer: She has 5 pounds of rye flour, 10 pounds of whole-wheat bread flour, and 3 pounds of chickpea flour.
She already had 2 pounds of whole-wheat pastry flour.
So she has 5 + 10 + 3 + 2 = 20 pounds of flour.
So, the final answer is 20.


Question: Bob gets rent assistance because he's low-income. If he gets a raise of $0.50/hour and works 40 hours a week, how much more will he actually earn a week if his housing benefit is reduced by $60/month?

Answer: Bob gets a raise of $0.50/hour and works 40 hours a week, so his weekly raise is $0.50 x 40 = $20.
His housing benefit is reduced by $60/month. Since there are 4 weeks in a month, his housing benefit is reduced by $60/4 = $15 per week.
So his net gain is $20 - $15 = $5 per week.
So, the final answer is 5.


Question: Jo reads at a steady pace. Her current book has 210 pages. Now, she is at page 90. An hour ago, she was at page 60. For how many hours will she be reading the book?

"asdiv_explicit_examples": """Below you will find some questions followed by a wrong answer, a rationale and the correct answer.


Question: A report said that each day the average Youtube viewer watches 2 videos with each video lasting 7 minutes. Additionally they also watch 3 minutes of ads. According to the report, how many minutes total do people spend on Youtube?

Wrong answer: Each day, the average Youtube viewer watches 2 videos with each video lasting 7 minutes.
So they watch 2 x 7 = 14 minutes of videos.
So, the final answer is 14.

Rationale: The error occurs in the last line of the wrong answer. The wrong answer does not account for the 3 minutes of ads that the average Youtube viewer watches each day. The correct answer should include both the time spent watching videos and the time spent watching ads.

Correct answer: Each day, the average Youtube viewer watches 2 videos, and each video lasts 7 minutes, so the total time spent watching videos is 2 x 7 = 14 minutes.
Adding the 3 minutes spent watching ads, the total time spent on Youtube is 14 + 3 = 17 minutes.
So, the final answer is 17.


Question: Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 8 of his marbles at the playground. How many more marble did Ed have than Doug then?

Wrong answer: Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug. Doug lost 8 marbles.
So Ed had 22 - 8 = 14 more marbles than Doug.
So, the final answer is 14.

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The incorrect part of this line is the calculation of the difference in marbles between Ed and Doug after Doug lost his marbles. The difference should increase by 8, not decrease, because Doug lost 8 marbles while Ed's count remained the same.

Correct answer: Ed had 22 more marbles than Doug initially. When Doug lost 8 marbles, the difference increased by 8 because Ed's count remained unchanged.
Therefore, Ed had 22 + 8 = 30 more marbles than Doug at that point.
So, the final answer is 30.


Question: Mr. Peter harvested some pears. He picked 43 kg of the pears into a bag and 35 kg of the pears into another bag. If there were still 15 kg of pears left unpacked, how many kilograms of pears did Mr. Peter harvest?

Wrong answer: Mr. Peter harvested 43 kg + 35 kg = 78 kg of pears into bags.
So, the final answer is 78.

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The incorrect part of this line is the omission of the 15 kg of pears that were left unpacked. The total harvest should include both the packed and unpacked pears. Therefore, the correct calculation should be 43 kg + 35 kg + 15 kg = 93 kg.

Correct answer: Mr. Peter picked 43 kg of pears into one bag and 35 kg into another, for a total of 43 + 35 = 78 kg of packed pears.
With 15 kg of pears left unpacked, the total harvest was 78 + 15 = 93 kg.

Question: A number machine changes the value of the numbers placed inside it. My number machine will add 15 to a number and then subtract 6 from the sum. If I put in the number 68, what number will come out of the machine?

Wrong answer: The machine adds 15 to 68, so it becomes 68 + 15 = 83.
So, the final answer is 83.

Rationale: The error occurs in the wrong answer because it does not complete the second step of the number machine's process. After adding 15 to 68, the machine then subtracts 6 from the sum. The wrong answer only completes the first step, resulting in an incorrect final answer. The correct answer must include both steps of the process.

Correct answer: When 68 is placed into the machine, it first adds 15, resulting in 68 + 15 = 83.
Then it subtracts 6, giving 83 - 6 = 77.
So, the final answer is 77.


Question: A group of nine friends went into a restaurant. The chef already had two chicken wings cooked but cooked twenty-five more for the group. If they each got the same amount, how many would each person get?

Wrong answer: The chef cooked 25 wings for the group.
25 wings for 9 people is 25/9 = 2.77 wings per person.
So, the final answer is 2.77.

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The incorrect part of this line is the calculation of the total number of chicken wings. The problem states that the chef already had two chicken wings cooked and cooked twenty-five more, so the total number of chicken wings is 27, not 25. Therefore, when dividing the total number of chicken wings by the number of friends, the correct answer is 3, not 2.77.

Correct answer: The chef had 2 chicken wings already cooked and cooked 25 more, for a total of 2 + 25 = 27 chicken wings.
Dividing them equally among the 9 friends, each person would get 27/9 = 3 chicken wings.
So, the final answer is 3.


Question: Emily was playing a trivia game. In the first round she scored 16 points and in the second round she scored 33 points. In the last round she lost 48 points. How many points did she have at the end of the game?

Wrong answer: Emily had 16 points in the first round and 33 points in the second round.
So she had 16 + 33 = 49 points.
So, the final answer is 49.

Rationale: The error occurs in the wrong answer because it does not take into account the points Emily lost in the last round. The correct calculation should subtract the points lost from the total points earned in the first two rounds.

Correct answer: Emily scored 16 points in the first round and 33 points in the second round, giving her a total of 16 + 33 = 49 points.
In the last round, she lost 48 points, so her final score was 49 - 48 = 1 point.
So, the final answer is 1.


Question: A tourist group has 26 people. At a hotel, they want to rent some large rooms for 3 people each and some small rooms for 2 each. In order to rent the least number of rooms and have every room fully occupied, how many large rooms should be rented?

Wrong answer: The tourist group has 26 people. They want to rent large rooms for 3 people each and small rooms for 2 people each.
The number of large rooms needed is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to 26/3 = 8.67.
So the number of large rooms needed is 9.
So, the final answer is 9.

Rationale: The error occurs in line 3 of the wrong answer. The wrong answer incorrectly rounds up the number of large rooms needed. The problem asks for the least number of rooms to be rented, so the number of large rooms should be rounded down, not up. The remaining people can be accommodated in a small room.

Correct answer: To minimize the number of rooms, as many large rooms as possible should be rented.
Each large room holds 3 people, so dividing 26 by 3 gives 26 ÷ 3 = 8 with a remainder of 2.
Thus, 8 large rooms are rented for 8 x 3 = 24 people, and the remaining 2 people will occupy one small room. Therefore, 8 large rooms should be rented.
So, the final answer is 8.


Question: Lena had some pocket money. She lost $4 and her mom gave her $9. If she had $66 after that, how many dollars did Lena have at first?

Wrong answer: Lena had some pocket money. She lost $4 and her mom gave her $9. 
So she lost $4 and gained $9. So she lost $4 - $9 = $5. 
She had $66 after that. So she had $66 + $5 = $71 at first. 
So, the final answer is 71.

Rationale: The error occurs in line 2 of the wrong answer. The incorrect part of this line is the calculation of the net gain. Lena lost $4 and gained $9, so she had a net gain of $9 - $4 = $5, not a loss of $4 - $9 = -$5. Therefore, to find the initial amount, we should subtract the net gain from the final amount, not add it.

Correct answer: After losing $4 and gaining $9, Lena had a net gain of 9 - 4 = 5 dollars.
Since she ended up with $66, she must have had 66 - 5 = 61 dollars initially.
So, the final answer is 61.""",

If he scored 760 on the GMAT and his average score for the mocks and the GMAT was 716.67, what was the difference in the score of his last mock and his GMAT score?

Answer: Let the score of Mike's first mock test be x. The scores of the 5 mock tests are x, x+10, x+20, x+30, x+40.
The total score for the 5 mock tests is 5x + 100. Including the GMAT score of 760, the total score for all 6 tests is 5x + 860.
The average score is 716.67, so (5x + 860) / 6 = 716.67. Multiplying both sides by 6, we get 5x + 860 = 4300, so 5x = 3440 and x = 688.
The mock test scores are 688, 698, 708, 718, and 728. The difference between the last mock test score (728) and the GMAT score (760) is 32.
So, the final answer is 32.


Question: What will be the difference in simple and compound interest on 2000 after three years at the rate of 10 percent per annum?

Answer: For simple interest, the formula is SI = P × R × T / 100. Using P = 2000, R = 10, and T = 3, SI = 2000 × 10 × 3 / 100 = 600.
For compound interest, the formula is CI = P × (1 + R/100)^T - P. Using P = 2000, R = 10, and T = 3, CI = 2000 × (1 + 10/100)^3 - 2000 = 2000 × (1.1)^3 - 2000 = 2000 × 1.331 - 2000 = 2662 - 2000 = 662.
The difference between compound and simple interest is 662 - 600 = 62.
So, the final answer is 62.


Question: There are 8 players in a chess group, and each player plays each of the others once. Given that each game is played by two players, how many total games will be played?

Answer: The total number of games played is the number of ways to choose 2 players from 8.
This is given by the combination formula C(n, 2), where n is the number of players. So, C(8, 2) = 8 × 7 / 2 = 28. Therefore, 28 games will be played.
So, the final answer is 28.


Question: The output of a factory was increased by 10% to keep up with rising demand. To handle the holiday rush, this new output was increased by 20%. By approximately what percent would the output now have to be decreased in order to restore the original output?

Answer: The factory's output was increased by 10%, so the new output is 1.10 times the original output.
Then, it was increased by 20%, so the output becomes 1.10 * 1.20 = 1.32 times the original output.
To restore the original output, we need to decrease the current output (1.32 times the original) to 1.
The required percentage decrease is (1.32 - 1) / 1.32 * 100 = 0.32 / 1.32 * 100 ≈ 24.24%. Therefore, the output must be decreased by approximately 24%.
So, the final answer is 24.


Question: A train 500 m long can cross an electric pole in 20 sec and then find the speed of the train?

Answer: The length of the train is 500 m, and it crosses an electric pole in 20 seconds. The speed of the train is given by the formula speed = distance / time.
So, the speed of the train is 500 m / 20 sec = 25 m/s. To convert this to km/h, multiply by 18/5: 25 * 18/5 = 90 km/h. Therefore, the speed of the train is 90 km/h.
So, the final answer is 90.


Question: The smallest number when increased by " 1 " is exactly divisible by 6,9,15,35,45 is?

Answer: The smallest number that is divisible by 6, 9, 15, 35, and 45 is the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.
First, find the prime factorization of each: 6 = 2 × 3, 9 = 3², 15 = 3 × 5, 35 = 5 × 7, 45 = 3² × 5. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors: 2 × 3² × 5 × 7 = 630.
The smallest number when increased by 1 is divisible by 630, so the smallest number is 630 - 1 = 629.
So, the final answer is 629.


Question: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?

Answer: To type the numbers from 1 to 500, we count the keystrokes for each group of numbers.
Numbers from 1 to 9 require 1 keystroke each, so that's 9 keystrokes.
Numbers from 10 to 99 require 2 keystrokes each, and there are 90 such numbers, so 90 * 2 = 180 keystrokes.
Numbers from 100 to 499 require 3 keystrokes each, and there are 400 such numbers, so 400 * 3 = 1200 keystrokes.
Finally, number 500 requires 3 keystrokes. Adding all these up: 9 + 180 + 1200 + 3 = 1392 keystrokes. Therefore, 1392 keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500.
So, the final answer is 1392.""",

Question: The speed at which a man can row a boat in still water is 25 kmph. If he rows downstream, where the speed of current is 11 kmph, what time will he take to cover 80 metres?

Wrong answer: The speed of the boat downstream is 25 kmph + 11 kmph = 36 kmph.
So, the final answer is 36.

Rationale: The error occurs in the wrong answer when the person does not convert the speed from km/h to m/s and the distance from meters to kilometers. The person also does not calculate the time it takes to cover the distance. The correct answer is found by first adding the man's speed to the current's speed to find the effective speed downstream. Then, convert the distance to be covered from meters to kilometers. Finally, divide the distance by the speed to find the time it takes to cover the distance, and convert this time from hours to seconds.

Correct answer: The man's speed in still water is 25 km/h and the current's speed is 11 km/h, so his effective speed downstream is 25 + 11 = 36 km/h.
The distance to be covered is 80 meters, which is 0.08 kilometers.
The time to cover the distance is time = distance ÷ speed = 0.08 km ÷ 36 km/h = 0.00222 hours. Converting this to seconds, we multiply by 3600: 0.00222 × 3600 = 8 seconds. 
So, the final answer is 8.


Question: Mike took 5 mock tests before appearing for the GMAT. In each mock test he scored 10 points more than the previous mock test. If he scored 760 on the GMAT and his average score for the mocks and the GMAT was 716.67, what was the difference in the score of his last mock and his GMAT score?

Wrong answer: The average of 5 scores is 716.67. So the sum of the 5 scores is 5 x 716.67 = 3583.35.
So, the final answer is 3583.35.

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The wrong answer incorrectly calculates the sum of the 5 scores as the average score times 5. However, the average score given in the problem includes both the mock tests and the GMAT score, which is a total of 6 tests, not 5. The correct method is to set up an equation using the average score and the total number of tests, then solve for the score of the first mock test. From there, the scores of the other mock tests can be calculated, and the difference between the last mock test and the GMAT score can be found.

Correct answer: Let the score of Mike's first mock test be x. The scores of the 5 mock tests are x, x+10, x+20, x+30, x+40.
The total score for the 5 mock tests is 5x + 100. Including the GMAT score of 760, the total score for all 6 tests is 5x + 860.
The average score is 716.67, so (5x + 860) / 6 = 716.67. Multiplying both sides by 6, we get 5x + 860 = 4300, so 5x = 3440 and x = 688.
The mock test scores are 688, 698, 708, 718, and 728. The difference between the last mock test score (728) and the GMAT score (760) is 32.
So, the final answer is 32.


Question: What will be the difference in simple and compound interest on 2000 after three years at the rate of 10 percent per annum?

Wrong answer: The simple interest on 2000 for 3 years at 10 percent per annum is 2000 x 10 x 3/100 = 600.
So, the final answer is 600.

Rationale: The error occurs in the wrong answer because it only calculates the simple interest and does not calculate the compound interest. The problem asks for the difference between the simple and compound interest, so both must be calculated. The correct answer calculates both the simple and compound interest and then subtracts the simple interest from the compound interest to find the difference.

Correct answer: For simple interest, the formula is SI = P × R × T / 100. Using P = 2000, R = 10, and T = 3, SI = 2000 × 10 × 3 / 100 = 600.
For compound interest, the formula is CI = P × (1 + R/100)^T - P. Using P = 2000, R = 10, and T = 3, CI = 2000 × (1 + 10/100)^3 - 2000 = 2000 × (1.1)^3 - 2000 = 2000 × 1.331 - 2000 = 2662 - 2000 = 662.
The difference between compound and simple interest is 662 - 600 = 62.
So, the final answer is 62.


Question: There are 8 players in a chess group, and each player plays each of the others once. Given that each game is played by two players, how many total games will be played?

Wrong answer: Each player plays 7 games, and there are 8 players, so the total number of games is 8 x 7 = 56.
So, the final answer is 56.

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The wrong answer incorrectly calculates the total number of games by multiplying the number of players by the number of games each player plays. This results in double counting each game since each game involves two players. The correct method is to use the combination formula to find the number of ways to choose 2 players from 8, which gives the total number of games.

Correct answer: The total number of games played is the number of ways to choose 2 players from 8.
This is given by the combination formula C(n, 2), where n is the number of players. So, C(8, 2) = 8 × 7 / 2 = 28. Therefore, 28 games will be played.
So, the final answer is 28.


Question: The output of a factory was increased by 10% to keep up with rising demand. To handle the holiday rush, this new output was increased by 20%. By approximately what percent would the output now have to be decreased in order to restore the original output?

Wrong answer: The output was increased by 10% and then by 20%. 10% + 20% = 30%. So the output increased by 30%. To restore the original output, the output would have to be decreased by 30%.
So, the final answer is 30.

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The wrong answer incorrectly adds the percentages of increase together to get a total increase of 30%. This is incorrect because the second increase of 20% is applied to the already increased output, not the original output. Therefore, the total increase is more than 30%. The correct method is to calculate the total increase as a multiplication of the individual increases, and then calculate the necessary decrease from this increased output.

Correct answer: The factory's output was increased by 10%, so the new output is 1.10 times the original output.
Then, it was increased by 20%, so the output becomes 1.10 * 1.20 = 1.32 times the original output.
To restore the original output, we need to decrease the current output (1.32 times the original) to 1.
The required percentage decrease is (1.32 - 1) / 1.32 * 100 = 0.32 / 1.32 * 100 ≈ 24.24%. Therefore, the output must be decreased by approximately 24%.
So, the final answer is 24.


Question: A train 500 m long can cross an electric pole in 20 sec and then find the speed of the train?

Wrong answer: The train crosses the pole in 20 seconds. The length of the train is 500 m. So the distance covered by the train in 20 seconds is 500 m.
The speed of the train is distance divided by time. So the speed of the train is 500 m / 20 sec = 25 m/s.
So, the final answer is 25.

Rationale: The error occurs in the last line of the wrong answer. The speed of the train is correctly calculated as 25 m/s, but the question asks for the speed in km/h. To convert from m/s to km/h, you need to multiply by 18/5. Therefore, the correct answer is 90 km/h, not 25 m/s.

Correct answer: The length of the train is 500 m, and it crosses an electric pole in 20 seconds. The speed of the train is given by the formula speed = distance / time.
So, the speed of the train is 500 m / 20 sec = 25 m/s. To convert this to km/h, multiply by 18/5: 25 * 18/5 = 90 km/h. Therefore, the speed of the train is 90 km/h.
So, the final answer is 90.


Question: The smallest number when increased by " 1 " is exactly divisible by 6,9,15,35,45 is?

Wrong answer: The smallest number is 24.
So, the final answer is 24.

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The wrong answer incorrectly assumes that the smallest number is 24 without any calculations or reasoning. The correct answer requires finding the least common multiple (LCM) of the given numbers and then subtracting 1 to find the smallest number that when increased by 1 is divisible by all the given numbers.

Correct answer: The smallest number that is divisible by 6, 9, 15, 35, and 45 is the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.
First, find the prime factorization of each: 6 = 2 × 3, 9 = 3², 15 = 3 × 5, 35 = 5 × 7, 45 = 3² × 5. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors: 2 × 3² × 5 × 7 = 630.
The smallest number when increased by 1 is divisible by 630, so the smallest number is 630 - 1 = 629.
So, the final answer is 629.


Question: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?

Wrong answer: The numbers from 1 to 10 require 10 keystrokes.
So, the final answer is 10.

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The wrong answer incorrectly assumes that the numbers from 1 to 10 require 10 keystrokes and that this pattern continues for all numbers up to 500. However, this is not the case as numbers from 10 to 99 require 2 keystrokes each, numbers from 100 to 499 require 3 keystrokes each, and the number 500 requires 3 keystrokes. Therefore, the total number of keystrokes needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500 is 1392, not 10.

Correct answer: To type the numbers from 1 to 500, we count the keystrokes for each group of numbers.
Numbers from 1 to 9 require 1 keystroke each, so that's 9 keystrokes.
Numbers from 10 to 99 require 2 keystrokes each, and there are 90 such numbers, so 90 * 2 = 180 keystrokes.
Numbers from 100 to 499 require 3 keystrokes each, and there are 400 such numbers, so 400 * 3 = 1200 keystrokes.
Finally, number 500 requires 3 keystrokes. Adding all these up: 9 + 180 + 1200 + 3 = 1392 keystrokes. Therefore, 1392 keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500.
So, the final answer is 1392.""",

Question: A train 500 m long can cross an electric pole in 20 sec and then find the speed of the train?

Wrong answer: The train crosses the pole in 20 seconds. The length of the train is 500 m. So the distance covered by the train in 20 seconds is 500 m.
The speed of the train is distance divided by time. So the speed of the train is 500 m / 20 sec = 25 m/s.
So, the final answer is 25.

Correct answer: The length of the train is 500 m, and it crosses an electric pole in 20 seconds. The speed of the train is given by the formula speed = distance / time.
So, the speed of the train is 500 m / 20 sec = 25 m/s. To convert this to km/h, multiply by 18/5: 25 * 18/5 = 90 km/h. Therefore, the speed of the train is 90 km/h.

Question: Mike took 5 mock tests before appearing for the GMAT. In each mock test he scored 10 points more than the previous mock test. If he scored 760 on the GMAT and his average score for the mocks and the GMAT was 716.67, what was the difference in the score of his last mock and his GMAT score?

Answer: Let the score of Mike's first mock test be x. The scores of the 5 mock tests are x, x+10, x+20, x+30, x+40.
The total score for the 5 mock tests is 5x + 100. Including the GMAT score of 760, the total score for all 6 tests is 5x + 860.
The average score is 716.67, so (5x + 860) / 6 = 716.67. Multiplying both sides by 6, we get 5x + 860 = 4300, so 5x = 3440 and x = 688.
The mock test scores are 688, 698, 708, 718, and 728. The difference between the last mock test score (728) and the GMAT score (760) is 32.

Question: What will be the difference in simple and compound interest on 2000 after three years at the rate of 10 percent per annum?

Answer: For simple interest, the formula is SI = P × R × T / 100. Using P = 2000, R = 10, and T = 3, SI = 2000 × 10 × 3 / 100 = 600.
For compound interest, the formula is CI = P × (1 + R/100)^T - P. Using P = 2000, R = 10, and T = 3, CI = 2000 × (1 + 10/100)^3 - 2000 = 2000 × (1.1)^3 - 2000 = 2000 × 1.331 - 2000 = 2662 - 2000 = 662.
The difference between compound and simple interest is 662 - 600 = 62.

Question: The output of a factory was increased by 10% to keep up with rising demand. To handle the holiday rush, this new output was increased by 20%. By approximately what percent would the output now have to be decreased in order to restore the original output?

Answer: The factory's output was increased by 10%, so the new output is 1.10 times the original output.
Then, it was increased by 20%, so the output becomes 1.10 * 1.20 = 1.32 times the original output.
To restore the original output, we need to decrease the current output (1.32 times the original) to 1.
The required percentage decrease is (1.32 - 1) / 1.32 * 100 = 0.32 / 1.32 * 100 ≈ 24.24%. Therefore, the output must be decreased by approximately 24%.
So, the final answer is 24.


Question: A train 500 m long can cross an electric pole in 20 sec and then find the speed of the train?

Answer: The length of the train is 500 m, and it crosses an electric pole in 20 seconds. The speed of the train is given by the formula speed = distance / time.
So, the speed of the train is 500 m / 20 sec = 25 m/s. To convert this to km/h, multiply by 18/5: 25 * 18/5 = 90 km/h. Therefore, the speed of the train is 90 km/h.
So, the final answer is 90.


Question: The smallest number when increased by " 1 " is exactly divisible by 6,9,15,35,45 is?

Answer: The smallest number that is divisible by 6, 9, 15, 35, and 45 is the least common multiple (LCM) of these numbers.
First, find the prime factorization of each: 6 = 2 × 3, 9 = 3², 15 = 3 × 5, 35 = 5 × 7, 45 = 3² × 5. The LCM is the product of the highest powers of all prime factors: 2 × 3² × 5 × 7 = 630.
The smallest number when increased by 1 is divisible by 630, so the smallest number is 630 - 1 = 629.
So, the final answer is 629.


Question: How many keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500?

Answer: To type the numbers from 1 to 500, we count the keystrokes for each group of numbers.
Numbers from 1 to 9 require 1 keystroke each, so that's 9 keystrokes.
Numbers from 10 to 99 require 2 keystrokes each, and there are 90 such numbers, so 90 * 2 = 180 keystrokes.
Numbers from 100 to 499 require 3 keystrokes each, and there are 400 such numbers, so 400 * 3 = 1200 keystrokes.
Finally, number 500 requires 3 keystrokes. Adding all these up: 9 + 180 + 1200 + 3 = 1392 keystrokes. Therefore, 1392 keystrokes are needed to type the numbers from 1 to 500.
So, the final answer is 1392.


Question: In a two-digit number, the digit in the unit's place is four times the digit in ten's place and the sum of the digits is equal to 10. What is the number?

Answer: Let the digit in the ten's place be x and the digit in the unit's place be 4x. The sum of the digits is x + 4x = 10, so 5x = 10, which gives x = 2. Therefore, the digit in the unit's place is 4 * 2 = 8. The number is 28.
So, the final answer is 28.


Question: A board 7ft. 9 inches long is divided into 3 equal parts . What is the length of each part?	

Answer: The total length of the board is 7 feet 9 inches, which is equivalent to 7 × 12 + 9 = 93 inches. The board is divided into 3 equal parts, so the length of each part is 93 / 3 = 31 inches. Therefore, each part is 31 inches long.
So, the final answer is 31.


Question: The diagonals of a rhombus are 18 cm and 22 cm. Find its area?

Answer: The area of a rhombus is given by the formula Area = (d₁ × d₂) / 2, where d₁ and d₂ are the lengths of the diagonals. Here, d₁ = 18 cm and d₂ = 22 cm. So, the area = (18 × 22) / 2 = 396 / 2 = 198 cm². Therefore, the area of the rhombus is 198 cm².
So, the final answer is 198.


Question: The rental charge for a car is 34 cents for the first 1/4 mile driven and 6 cents for every 1/5 mile driven over the initial 1/4 mile. If a man paid $1.24 in rental charges, how many miles did he drive?

Answer: The initial charge for the first 1/4 mile is 34 cents. After that, the charge is 6 cents for every 1/5 mile. The total rental charge is $1.24, which is 124 cents.
Subtracting the initial 34 cents, the remaining charge is 124 - 34 = 90 cents. Each additional 1/5 mile costs 6 cents, so the number of 1/5 miles driven is 90 / 6 = 15.
Therefore, the total distance driven is the initial 1/4 mile plus 15 times 1/5 mile, or 1/4 + 15/5 = 1/4 + 3 = 3.25 miles. Therefore, the man drove 3.25 miles.
So, the final answer is 3.25.


Question: How many numbers from 39 to 79 are exactly divisible by 11?

Answer: The smallest number divisible by 11 between 39 and 79 is 44 (11 * 4).
The largest number divisible by 11 between 39 and 79 is 77 (11 * 7).
The numbers divisible by 11 are 44, 55, 66, and 77. Therefore, there are 4 numbers divisible by 11.
So, the final answer is 4.

Question: A set contains four numbers. The six pairwise sums of distinct elements of the set, in no particular order, are $189$, $320$, $287$, $234$, $x$, and $y$. Find the greatest possible value of $x+y$.

Answer: For such a set $\{a, b, c, d\},$ the six pairwise sums can be themselves paired up into three pairs which all have the same sum: \[\begin{aligned} a+b\; &\text{ with } \;c+d, \\  a+c\; &\text{ with }\; b+d, \\  a+d \;&\text{ with } \;b+c. \end{aligned}\]Thus, the sum of all six pairwise sums is $3S,$ where $S = a+b+c+d,$ and so in our case, \[x+y=3S - (189 + 320 + 287 + 234) = 3S - 1030.\]Therefore, we want to maximize $S.$
Because of the pairing of the six pairwise sums, $S$ must be the sum of two of the four given numbers $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ and $234,$ so the greatest possible value of $S$ is $320 + 287 = 607.$ Therefore, the greatest possible value of $x+y$ is $3(607) - 1030 = 791.$ This value is achievable for the set $\{51.5, 137.5, 182.5, 235.5\},$ which has pairwise sums $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ $234,$ $373,$ and $418.$ Therefore the answer is $\boxed{791}.$


Question: In right $\Delta ABC$, $\angle CAB$ is a right angle. Point $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$. What is the number of centimeters in the length of median $\overline{AM}$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy] pair A,B,C,M;
A = (0,0); B = (4,0); C = (0,3); M = (B+C)/2;

[/asy]

Answer: The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the hypotenuse.  The hypotenuse of $\triangle ABC$ is $\sqrt{3^2+4^2} = 5$, so $AM = BC/2 = \boxed{2.5}$.


Question: An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$

Answer: In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$


Question: What is the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers?

Answer: The units digit of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. The units digit of the square of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 9, or 5: $1^2=1$, $3^2=9$, $5^2=25$, $7^2=49$, $9^2=81$. Of every five consecutive odd, positive integers, exactly 2 end in 1 or 9, exactly 2 end in 3 or 7, and exactly 1 ends in 5. Therefore, of the squares of the first $2005=5\cdot401$ odd, positive integers, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 1, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 9, and exactly $\frac{1}{5}\cdot2005=401$ end in 5. The remaining two squares end in 1 ($1^2$) and 9 ($3^2$), respectively. Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is the units digit of the sum $802\cdot1+802\cdot9+401\cdot5+1+9$, which is $ \boxed{5}$, the units digit of $2+8+5+0=15$.


Question: Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a King and the second card is a $\heartsuit$?

Answer: We have two cases because if the first card is a King, it could be a $\heartsuit$ or not be a $\heartsuit$.
There is a $\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the King of $\heartsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{12}{51} = \dfrac{4}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the twelve remaining $\heartsuit$, which gives a probability of $\dfrac{1}{52} \times \dfrac{4}{17} = \dfrac{1}{221}$ chance that this occurs.
There is a $\dfrac{3}{52}$ chance that a non-$\heartsuit$ King is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{13}{51}$ chance that a $\heartsuit$ is drawn second, giving a $\dfrac{3}{52} \times \dfrac{13}{51} = \dfrac{1}{68}$ chance that this occurs.
So the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\dfrac{1}{221} + \dfrac{1}{68} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{52}}$.


Question: Find all the solutions to
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} = 4 \sqrt[3]{x}.\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.

Answer: From the given equation,
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} - 4 \sqrt[3]{x} = 0.\]We can also write this as
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} + \sqrt[3]{-64x} = 0.\]Let $a = \sqrt[3]{15x - 1},$ $b = \sqrt[3]{13x + 1},$ and $c = \sqrt[3]{-64x},$ so $a + b + c = 0.$  From the factorization
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ab - bc),\]we have that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc.$  Hence,
\[-36x = 3 \sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)(-64x)}.\]We can simplify this to
\[3x = \sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)x}.\]Cubing both sides we, get $27x^3 = 195x^3 + 2x^2 - x,$ so $168x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0.$  This factors as $x(14x - 1)(12x + 1) = 0,$ so the solutions are $\boxed{0, \frac{1}{14}, -\frac{1}{12}}.$


Question: The number $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30. If you divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. What is the value of $n$?

Answer: We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\boxed{29}$.

OR

When we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.


Question: Compute $\tan 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ.$

Answer: We can write
\begin{align*}
\tan 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ &= \frac{\sin 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} + 4 \sin 20^\circ \\
&= \frac{\sin 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.
\end{align*}By double angle formula,
\[\frac{\sin 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.\]Then by sum-to-product,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} &= \frac{\sin 20^\circ + \sin 40^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin 30^\circ \cos 10^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos 10^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos 10^\circ + \cos 50^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.
\end{align*}Again by sum-to-product,
\[\frac{\cos 10^\circ + \cos 50^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = \frac{2 \cos 30^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = 2 \cos 30^\circ = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}.\]""",

Question: A set contains four numbers. The six pairwise sums of distinct elements of the set, in no particular order, are $189$, $320$, $287$, $234$, $x$, and $y$. Find the greatest possible value of $x+y$.

Wrong answer: Let the four numbers in the set be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.  We know that $a+b=189$, $a+c=320$, $a+d=287$, $b+c=234$, $b+d=x$, and $c+d=y$.  We want to maximize $x+y=b+d+c+d=b+2c+d=234+2(320-a)-a=934-3a$.  Since $a$ is a sum of two distinct elements of the set, it must be at least $189-320+287=156$.  Therefore, the maximum possible value of $x+y$ is $934-3(156)=\\boxed{466}$.\nTherefore the final answer is $\boxed{466}.$

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The incorrect assumption in Line 1 is that $a+b=189$, $a+c=320$, $a+d=287$, $b+c=234$, $b+d=x$, and $c+d=y$. This is not necessarily true. The six pairwise sums can be paired up into three pairs which all have the same sum. Therefore, the sum of all six pairwise sums is $3S,$ where $S = a+b+c+d,$ and so in our case, $x+y=3S - (189 + 320 + 287 + 234) = 3S - 1030.$ Therefore, we want to maximize $S.$ Because of the pairing of the six pairwise sums, $S$ must be the sum of two of the four given numbers $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ and $234,$ so the greatest possible value of $S$ is $320 + 287 = 607.$ Therefore, the greatest possible value of $x+y$ is $3(607) - 1030 = 791.$ This value is achievable for the set $\{51.5, 137.5, 182.5, 235.5\},$ which has pairwise sums $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ $234,$ $373,$ and $418.$ Therefore the answer is $791.$

Correct answer: For such a set $\{a, b, c, d\},$ the six pairwise sums can be themselves paired up into three pairs which all have the same sum: \[\begin{aligned} a+b\; &\text{ with } \;c+d, \\  a+c\; &\text{ with }\; b+d, \\  a+d \;&\text{ with } \;b+c. \end{aligned}\]Thus, the sum of all six pairwise sums is $3S,$ where $S = a+b+c+d,$ and so in our case, \[x+y=3S - (189 + 320 + 287 + 234) = 3S - 1030.\]Therefore, we want to maximize $S.$
Because of the pairing of the six pairwise sums, $S$ must be the sum of two of the four given numbers $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ and $234,$ so the greatest possible value of $S$ is $320 + 287 = 607.$ Therefore, the greatest possible value of $x+y$ is $3(607) - 1030 = 791.$ This value is achievable for the set $\{51.5, 137.5, 182.5, 235.5\},$ which has pairwise sums $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ $234,$ $373,$ and $418.$ Therefore the answer is $\boxed{791}.$


Question: In right $\Delta ABC$, $\angle CAB$ is a right angle. Point $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$. What is the number of centimeters in the length of median $\overline{AM}$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy] pair A,B,C,M;
A = (0,0); B = (4,0); C = (0,3); M = (B+C)/2;

label("$C$",C,W); label("$M$",M,NE);
label("3 cm",A--C,W); label("4 cm",A--B,S);
[/asy]

Wrong answer: We are given a right triangle $\\Delta ABC$ with a right angle at $A$. We are also given that $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$. We need to find the length of the median $\\overline{AM}$.\n\nLet's start by using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse $\\overline{AB}$:\n\n$$AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$$\n\nWe are given that $AC = 3$ cm and $BC = 4$ cm, so:\n\n$$AB^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$$\n\n$$AB = \\sqrt{25} = 5$$ cm\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle $\\Delta AMB$. We know that $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, so $BM = MC = 2$ cm.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of $\\overline{AM}$:\n\n$$AM^2 = AB^2 - BM^2$$\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n$$AM^2 = 5^2 - 2^2 = 25 - 4 = 21$$\n\n$$AM = \\sqrt{21} \\approx 4.6$$ cm\n\nSo, the length of the median $\\overline{AM}$ is approximately $\\boxed{4.6}$ cm.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{4.6}.$

Rationale: The error occurs in the wrong answer when the Pythagorean theorem is incorrectly applied to triangle $\Delta AMB$. The Pythagorean theorem is used to find the length of a side in a right triangle, but $\Delta AMB$ is not a right triangle. The correct approach is to use the property of a right triangle that states the length of the median to the hypotenuse is half the length of the hypotenuse. Therefore, since the hypotenuse $BC$ is 5 cm, the length of the median $AM$ is $5/2 = 2.5$ cm.

Correct answer: The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the hypotenuse.  The hypotenuse of $\triangle ABC$ is $\sqrt{3^2+4^2} = 5$, so $AM = BC/2 = \boxed{2.5}$.


Question: An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$

Wrong answer: We can eliminate the parameter $t$ by solving for $\\cos t$ and $\\sin t$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.  We have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{2 (\\sin t - 1)}{2 - \\cos t}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x(2 - \\cos t) &= 2 (\\sin t - 1)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x - x\\cos t &= 2\\sin t - 2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x\\cos t &= 2x + 2 - 2\\sin t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\cos t &= \\frac{2x + 2 - 2\\sin t}{x}\\\\\n\\end{align*}and\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{3 (\\cos t - 5)}{2 - \\cos t}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y(2 - \\cos t) &= 3 (\\cos t - 5)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2y - y\\cos t &= 3\\cos t - 15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y\\cos t &= 2y - 3\\cos t + 15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\cos t &= \\frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}\\\\\n\\end{align*}Equating the two expressions for $\\cos t$, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2x + 2 - 2\\sin t}{x} &= \\frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (2x + 2 - 2\\sin t)(y + 3) &= x(2y + 15)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2xy + 6x - 2y\\sin t - 6\\sin t &= 2xy + 15x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6x - 2y\\sin t - 6\\sin t &= 15x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9x - 2y\\sin t - 6\\sin t &= 0\\\\\n\\end{align*}Similarly, we have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{2 (\\sin t - 1)}{2 - \\cos t}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x(2 - \\cos t) &= 2 (\\sin t - 1)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x - x\\cos t &= 2\\sin t - 2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x - 2 &= x\\cos t + 2\\sin t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x - 2 &= \\frac{2x + 2 - 2\\sin t}{x}x + 2\\sin t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x - 2 &= 2x + 2 - 2\\sin t + 2\\sin t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2\\sin t &= 4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\sin t &= 2\\\\\n\\end{align*}Substituting this into the equation above, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n9x - 2y(2) - 6(2) &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9x - 4y - 12 &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9x - 4y - 12 + 0 &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9x - 4y - 12 &= 0\\\\\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $A = 9$, $B = 0$, $C = -4$, $D = 0$, $E = 0$, and $F = -12$.  Thus, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 9 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 12 = \\boxed{25}.$\nThe final answer is $\boxed{25}.$

Rationale: The error occurs in the wrong answer when the student incorrectly solves for $\sin t$ in terms of $x$ and $y$. The student incorrectly assumes that $\sin t = 2$, which is not possible as the sine function is bounded between -1 and 1. This leads to an incorrect equation for the ellipse and thus an incorrect final answer. The correct approach is to solve for $\cos t$ and $\sin t$ in terms of $x$ and $y$ from the given parametric equations, and then substitute these into the identity $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1$ to get the equation of the ellipse.

Correct answer: In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$


Question: What is the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers?

Wrong answer: The first 2007 odd, positive integers are: 1, 3, 5, ..., 4009 (since 2*2007 - 1 = 4009).\n\nWe need to find the units digit of the sum of their squares.\n\nLet's analyze the units digits of the squares of these odd numbers:\n\n* The units digit of the square of any odd number ending in 1 is 1 (e.g., 1^2 = 1, 11^2 = 121, 21^2 = 441, ...).\n* The units digit of the square of any odd number ending in 3 is 9 (e.g., 3^2 = 9, 13^2 = 169, 23^2 = 529, ...).\n* The units digit of the square of any odd number ending in 5 is 5 (e.g., 5^2 = 25, 15^2 = 225, 25^2 = 625, ...).\n* The units digit of the square of any odd number ending in 7 is 9 (e.g., 7^2 = 49, 17^2 = 289, 27^2 = 729, ...).\n* The units digit of the square of any odd number ending in 9 is 1 (e.g., 9^2 = 81, 19^2 = 361, 29^2 = 841, ...).\n\nNow, let's group the first 2007 odd, positive integers into these categories:\n\n* Numbers ending in 1: 1, 11, 21, ..., 4001 (667 numbers)\n* Numbers ending in 3: 3, 13, 23, ..., 4003 (668 numbers)\n* Numbers ending in 5: 5, 15, 25, ..., 4005 (668 numbers)\n* Numbers ending in 7: 7, 17, 27, ..., 4007 (668 numbers)\n* Numbers ending in 9: 9, 19, 29, ..., 4009 (668 numbers)\n\nThe sum of the squares of these numbers will have a units digit that is the sum of the units digits of the squares of each group:\n\n* 667 numbers with units digit 1: 667*1 = 667 (units digit is 7)\n* 668 numbers with units digit 9: 668*9 = 6022 (units digit is 2)\n* 668 numbers with units digit 5: 668*5 = 3340 (units digit is 0)\n* 668 numbers with units digit 9: 668*9 = 6022 (units digit is 2)\n* 668 numbers with units digit 1: 668*1 = 668 (units digit is 8)\n\nAdding up the units digits, we get: 7 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 8 = 19\n\nSo, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is 9.\n\nAnswer: $\boxed{9}.$

Rationale: The error occurs in the wrong answer when the numbers are grouped based on their units digit. The assumption that the number of odd numbers ending in each digit (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) is equal is incorrect. The correct approach is to consider the pattern of the units digit of the square of an odd number, which is 1, 9, or 5. Then, count the number of squares ending in each of these digits among the first 2005 odd numbers, and add the squares of the remaining two odd numbers (1 and 3). The units digit of this sum is the answer.

Correct answer: The units digit of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. The units digit of the square of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 9, or 5: $1^2=1$, $3^2=9$, $5^2=25$, $7^2=49$, $9^2=81$. Of every five consecutive odd, positive integers, exactly 2 end in 1 or 9, exactly 2 end in 3 or 7, and exactly 1 ends in 5. Therefore, of the squares of the first $2005=5\cdot401$ odd, positive integers, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 1, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 9, and exactly $\frac{1}{5}\cdot2005=401$ end in 5. The remaining two squares end in 1 ($1^2$) and 9 ($3^2$), respectively. Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is the units digit of the sum $802\cdot1+802\cdot9+401\cdot5+1+9$, which is $ \boxed{5}$, the units digit of $2+8+5+0=15$.


Question: Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a King and the second card is a $\heartsuit$?

Wrong answer: 1. The probability of the first card being a King:

There are 4 Kings in a standard deck of 52 cards (one in each suit). So, the probability of the first card being a King is:

P(King) = Number of Kings / Total number of cards\n= 4/52\n= 1/13

2. The probability of the second card being a $\\heartsuit$ given that the first card is a King:

Since the first card is a King, there are 51 cards left in the deck. Among these, there are 13 cards of the $\\heartsuit$ suit (including the King of $\\heartsuit$ which has already been removed).

So, the probability of the second card being a $\\heartsuit$ given that the first card is a King is:

P($\\heartsuit$ | King) = Number of $\\heartsuit$ cards left / Total number of cards left\n= 13/51

3. The probability of both events occurring:

Since the events are dependent (the second event depends on the first), we multiply the probabilities:

P(King and $\\heartsuit$) = P(King) × P($\\heartsuit$ | King)\n= (1/13) × (13/51)\n= 1/51

So, the probability that the first card is a King and the second card is a $\\heartsuit$ is 1/51.

Answer: 0.0196 (or 1/51 as a fraction)

Rationale: The error occurs in line 2 of the wrong answer. The calculation for the probability of the second card being a $\heartsuit$ given that the first card is a King is incorrect. The problem is that the calculation assumes that the King of $\heartsuit$ has already been removed from the deck, which is not necessarily the case. The first card could be any King, not just the King of $\heartsuit$. Therefore, there are still 13 $\heartsuit$ cards in the deck, not 12. The correct calculation should consider two cases: one where the first card is the King of $\heartsuit$ and one where the first card is a King of another suit. The probabilities of these two cases should then be added together to get the total probability.

Correct answer: We have two cases because if the first card is a King, it could be a $\heartsuit$ or not be a $\heartsuit$.
There is a $\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the King of $\heartsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{12}{51} = \dfrac{4}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the twelve remaining $\heartsuit$, which gives a probability of $\dfrac{1}{52} \times \dfrac{4}{17} = \dfrac{1}{221}$ chance that this occurs.
There is a $\dfrac{3}{52}$ chance that a non-$\heartsuit$ King is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{13}{51}$ chance that a $\heartsuit$ is drawn second, giving a $\dfrac{3}{52} \times \dfrac{13}{51} = \dfrac{1}{68}$ chance that this occurs.
So the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\dfrac{1}{221} + \dfrac{1}{68} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{52}}$.


Question: Find all the solutions to
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} = 4 \sqrt[3]{x}.\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.

Wrong answer: Let's solve the equation step by step.\n\n\\[\\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \\sqrt[3]{13x + 1} = 4 \\sqrt[3]{x}\\]\n\nFirst, let's cube both sides of the equation to eliminate the cube roots:\n\n\\[(\\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \\sqrt[3]{13x + 1})^3 = (4 \\sqrt[3]{x})^3\\]\n\nExpanding the left-hand side using the cube of a sum formula:\n\n\\[(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\]\n\nwe get:\n\n\\[(15x - 1) + 3\\sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)^2}\\sqrt[3]{13x + 1} + 3\\sqrt[3]{15x - 1}(\\sqrt[3]{13x + 1})^2 + (13x + 1) = 64x\\]\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n\\[28x - 2 + 3\\sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)^2(13x + 1)} + 3\\sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)^2} = 64x\\]\n\nSubtract 28x from both sides:\n\n\\[-2 + 3\\sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)^2(13x + 1)} + 3\\sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)^2} = 36x\\]\n\nNow, let's assume that the expression inside the cube roots is a perfect cube. This means that:\n\n\\[(15x - 1)^2(13x + 1) = a^3\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[(15x - 1)(13x + 1)^2 = b^3\\]\n\nfor some integers a and b.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[-2 + 3a + 3b = 36x\\]\n\nSubtract 3a and 3b from both sides:\n\n\\[-2 - 3a - 3b = 36x - 3a - 3b\\]\n\nNow, we can see that the left-hand side is an integer, and the right-hand side is a multiple of 36. This means that:\n\n\\[36x - 3a - 3b = 0\\]\n\nDivide by 36:\n\n\\[x - \\frac{a}{12} - \\frac{b}{12} = 0\\]\n\nNow, we can see that x must be an integer. Let's try some values of x.\n\nFor x = 1, we get:\n\n\\[(15 - 1)^2(13 + 1) = 196^3\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[(15 - 1)(13 + 1)^2 = 196^3\\]\n\nwhich is true.\n\nFor x = 2, we get:\n\n\\[(30 - 1)^2(26 + 1) = 841^3\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[(30 - 1)(26 + 1)^2 = 841^3\\]\n\nwhich is also true.\n\nHowever, for x = 3, we get:\n\n\\[(45 - 1)^2(39 + 1) = 1681^3\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[(45 - 1)(39 + 1)^2 = 1681^3\\]\n\nwhich is not true.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = 1 and x = 2.\n\nFinal answer: 1, 2

Rationale: The error occurs in the first line of the wrong answer. The student incorrectly cubes both sides of the equation, which leads to a more complicated equation that is not solvable. The correct approach is to rewrite the equation in a form that allows us to use the identity $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ac - bc)$, where $a + b + c = 0$. This leads to a simpler equation that can be factored and solved.

Correct answer: From the given equation,
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} - 4 \sqrt[3]{x} = 0.\]We can also write this as
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} + \sqrt[3]{-64x} = 0.\]Let $a = \sqrt[3]{15x - 1},$ $b = \sqrt[3]{13x + 1},$ and $c = \sqrt[3]{-64x},$ so $a + b + c = 0.$  From the factorization
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ab - bc),\]we have that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc.$  Hence,
\[-36x = 3 \sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)(-64x)}.\]We can simplify this to
\[3x = \sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)x}.\]Cubing both sides we, get $27x^3 = 195x^3 + 2x^2 - x,$ so $168x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0.$  This factors as $x(14x - 1)(12x + 1) = 0,$ so the solutions are $\boxed{0, \frac{1}{14}, -\frac{1}{12}}.$


Question: The number $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30. If you divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. What is the value of $n$?

Wrong answer: Since $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30, we know that $n$ is an integer greater than 20 and less than 30.\n\nThe problem states that when we divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. This means that we can write $n$ in the form:\n\n$$n = 8k + 5$$\n\nwhere $k$ is an integer.\n\nSince $n$ is between 20 and 30, we know that $k$ must be such that:\n\n$$20 < 8k + 5 < 30$$\n\nSubtracting 5 from all parts of the inequality, we get:\n\n$$15 < 8k < 25$$\n\nDividing all parts of the inequality by 8, we get:\n\n$$1.875 < k < 3.125$$\n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the only possible value of $k$ is:\n\n$$k = 2$$\n\nSubstituting this value of $k$ back into the equation $n = 8k + 5$, we get:\n\n$$n = 8(2) + 5 = 21$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is:\n\n$$\\boxed{21}$$

Rationale: The error occurs in the last line of the wrong answer. The problem states that $n$ is a prime number, but 21 is not a prime number because it has more than two distinct positive divisors. The correct answer is 29, which is a prime number and satisfies the conditions given in the problem. The wrong answer incorrectly assumed that $k$ must be an integer, but the problem does not state this. The correct answer is found by considering the multiples of 8 that, when added to 5, result in a number between 20 and 30. Only 29 is a prime number, so it is the correct answer.

Correct answer: We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\boxed{29}$.

OR

When we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.


Question: Compute $\tan 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ.$

Wrong answer: We have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\tan 20^\\circ + 4 \\sin 20^\\circ &= \\frac{\\sin 20^\\circ}{\\cos 20^\\circ} + 4 \\sin 20^\\circ \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sin 20^\\circ}{\\cos 20^\\circ} + \\frac{4 \\sin 20^\\circ \\cos 20^\\circ}{\\cos 20^\\circ} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sin 20^\\circ + 4 \\sin 20^\\circ \\cos 20^\\circ}{\\cos 20^\\circ} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sin 20^\\circ + 2 \\sin 40^\\circ}{\\cos 20^\\circ} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sin 20^\\circ + 2 \\sin 20^\\circ \\cos 20^\\circ}{\\cos 20^\\circ} \\\\\n&= \\frac{\\sin 20^\\circ(1 + 2 \\cos 20^\\circ)}{\\cos 20^\\circ} \\\\\n&= \\tan 20^\\circ (1 + 2 \\cos 20^\\circ) \\\\\n&\\approx 0.36397 \\cdot 2.8794 \\\\\n&\\approx \\boxed{1.045}.\n\\end{align*}\nAnswer: 1.045.

Rationale: The error occurs in line 5 of the wrong answer. The step where $\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ$ is incorrectly simplified to $\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ$ is wrong. The correct simplification should be $\sin 20^\circ + \sin 40^\circ + \sin 40^\circ$. The correct answer is obtained by using the double angle formula and the sum-to-product formula correctly.

Correct answer: We can write
\begin{align*}
\tan 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ &= \frac{\sin 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} + 4 \sin 20^\circ \\
&= \frac{\sin 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.
\end{align*}By double angle formula,
\[\frac{\sin 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.\]Then by sum-to-product,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} &= \frac{\sin 20^\circ + \sin 40^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin 30^\circ \cos 10^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos 10^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos 10^\circ + \cos 50^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.
\end{align*}Again by sum-to-product,
\[\frac{\cos 10^\circ + \cos 50^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = \frac{2 \cos 30^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = 2 \cos 30^\circ = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}.\]""",

Question: A set contains four numbers. The six pairwise sums of distinct elements of the set, in no particular order, are $189$, $320$, $287$, $234$, $x$, and $y$. Find the greatest possible value of $x+y$.

Wrong answer: Let the four numbers in the set be $a$, $b$, $c$, and $d$.  We know that $a+b=189$, $a+c=320$, $a+d=287$, $b+c=234$, $b+d=x$, and $c+d=y$.  We want to maximize $x+y=b+d+c+d=b+2c+d=234+2(320-a)-a=934-3a$.  Since $a$ is a sum of two distinct elements of the set, it must be at least $189-320+287=156$.  Therefore, the maximum possible value of $x+y$ is $934-3(156)=\\boxed{466}$.\nTherefore the final answer is $\boxed{466}.$

Correct answer: For such a set $\{a, b, c, d\},$ the six pairwise sums can be themselves paired up into three pairs which all have the same sum: \[\begin{aligned} a+b\; &\text{ with } \;c+d, \\  a+c\; &\text{ with }\; b+d, \\  a+d \;&\text{ with } \;b+c. \end{aligned}\]Thus, the sum of all six pairwise sums is $3S,$ where $S = a+b+c+d,$ and so in our case, \[x+y=3S - (189 + 320 + 287 + 234) = 3S - 1030.\]Therefore, we want to maximize $S.$
Because of the pairing of the six pairwise sums, $S$ must be the sum of two of the four given numbers $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ and $234,$ so the greatest possible value of $S$ is $320 + 287 = 607.$ Therefore, the greatest possible value of $x+y$ is $3(607) - 1030 = 791.$ This value is achievable for the set $\{51.5, 137.5, 182.5, 235.5\},$ which has pairwise sums $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ $234,$ $373,$ and $418.$ Therefore the answer is $\boxed{791}.$


Question: In right $\Delta ABC$, $\angle CAB$ is a right angle. Point $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$. What is the number of centimeters in the length of median $\overline{AM}$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy] pair A,B,C,M;
A = (0,0); B = (4,0); C = (0,3); M = (B+C)/2;

label("$A$",A,W); label("$B$",B,E);
label("$C$",C,W); label("$M$",M,NE);
label("3 cm",A--C,W); label("4 cm",A--B,S);
[/asy]

Wrong answer: We are given a right triangle $\\Delta ABC$ with a right angle at $A$. We are also given that $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$. We need to find the length of the median $\\overline{AM}$.\n\nLet's start by using the Pythagorean theorem to find the length of the hypotenuse $\\overline{AB}$:\n\n$$AB^2 = AC^2 + BC^2$$\n\nWe are given that $AC = 3$ cm and $BC = 4$ cm, so:\n\n$$AB^2 = 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25$$\n\n$$AB = \\sqrt{25} = 5$$ cm\n\nNow, let's consider the triangle $\\Delta AMB$. We know that $M$ is the midpoint of $\\overline{BC}$, so $BM = MC = 2$ cm.\n\nWe can use the Pythagorean theorem again to find the length of $\\overline{AM}$:\n\n$$AM^2 = AB^2 - BM^2$$\n\nSubstituting the values, we get:\n\n$$AM^2 = 5^2 - 2^2 = 25 - 4 = 21$$\n\n$$AM = \\sqrt{21} \\approx 4.6$$ cm\n\nSo, the length of the median $\\overline{AM}$ is approximately $\\boxed{4.6}$ cm.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{4.6}.$

Correct answer: The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the hypotenuse.  The hypotenuse of $\triangle ABC$ is $\sqrt{3^2+4^2} = 5$, so $AM = BC/2 = \boxed{2.5}$.


Question: An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$

Wrong answer: We can eliminate the parameter $t$ by solving for $\\cos t$ and $\\sin t$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.  We have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{2 (\\sin t - 1)}{2 - \\cos t}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x(2 - \\cos t) &= 2 (\\sin t - 1)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x - x\\cos t &= 2\\sin t - 2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x\\cos t &= 2x + 2 - 2\\sin t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\cos t &= \\frac{2x + 2 - 2\\sin t}{x}\\\\\n\\end{align*}and\n\n\\begin{align*}\ny &= \\frac{3 (\\cos t - 5)}{2 - \\cos t}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y(2 - \\cos t) &= 3 (\\cos t - 5)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2y - y\\cos t &= 3\\cos t - 15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad y\\cos t &= 2y - 3\\cos t + 15\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\cos t &= \\frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}\\\\\n\\end{align*}Equating the two expressions for $\\cos t$, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n\\frac{2x + 2 - 2\\sin t}{x} &= \\frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad (2x + 2 - 2\\sin t)(y + 3) &= x(2y + 15)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2xy + 6x - 2y\\sin t - 6\\sin t &= 2xy + 15x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 6x - 2y\\sin t - 6\\sin t &= 15x\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9x - 2y\\sin t - 6\\sin t &= 0\\\\\n\\end{align*}Similarly, we have that\n\n\\begin{align*}\nx &= \\frac{2 (\\sin t - 1)}{2 - \\cos t}\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad x(2 - \\cos t) &= 2 (\\sin t - 1)\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x - x\\cos t &= 2\\sin t - 2\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x - 2 &= x\\cos t + 2\\sin t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x - 2 &= \\frac{2x + 2 - 2\\sin t}{x}x + 2\\sin t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2x - 2 &= 2x + 2 - 2\\sin t + 2\\sin t\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 2\\sin t &= 4\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad \\sin t &= 2\\\\\n\\end{align*}Substituting this into the equation above, we have\n\n\\begin{align*}\n9x - 2y(2) - 6(2) &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9x - 4y - 12 &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9x - 4y - 12 + 0 &= 0\\\\\n\\Rightarrow\\qquad 9x - 4y - 12 &= 0\\\\\n\\end{align*}Therefore, $A = 9$, $B = 0$, $C = -4$, $D = 0$, $E = 0$, and $F = -12$.  Thus, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 9 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 0 + 12 = \\boxed{25}.$\nThe final answer is $\boxed{25}.$

Correct answer: In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$


Question: What is the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers?

Wrong answer: The first 2007 odd, positive integers are: 1, 3, 5, ..., 4009 (since 2*2007 - 1 = 4009).\n\nWe need to find the units digit of the sum of their squares.\n\nLet's analyze the units digits of the squares of these odd numbers:\n\n* The units digit of the square of any odd number ending in 1 is 1 (e.g., 1^2 = 1, 11^2 = 121, 21^2 = 441, ...).\n* The units digit of the square of any odd number ending in 3 is 9 (e.g., 3^2 = 9, 13^2 = 169, 23^2 = 529, ...).\n* The units digit of the square of any odd number ending in 5 is 5 (e.g., 5^2 = 25, 15^2 = 225, 25^2 = 625, ...).\n* The units digit of the square of any odd number ending in 7 is 9 (e.g., 7^2 = 49, 17^2 = 289, 27^2 = 729, ...).\n* The units digit of the square of any odd number ending in 9 is 1 (e.g., 9^2 = 81, 19^2 = 361, 29^2 = 841, ...).\n\nNow, let's group the first 2007 odd, positive integers into these categories:\n\n* Numbers ending in 1: 1, 11, 21, ..., 4001 (667 numbers)\n* Numbers ending in 3: 3, 13, 23, ..., 4003 (668 numbers)\n* Numbers ending in 5: 5, 15, 25, ..., 4005 (668 numbers)\n* Numbers ending in 7: 7, 17, 27, ..., 4007 (668 numbers)\n* Numbers ending in 9: 9, 19, 29, ..., 4009 (668 numbers)\n\nThe sum of the squares of these numbers will have a units digit that is the sum of the units digits of the squares of each group:\n\n* 667 numbers with units digit 1: 667*1 = 667 (units digit is 7)\n* 668 numbers with units digit 9: 668*9 = 6022 (units digit is 2)\n* 668 numbers with units digit 5: 668*5 = 3340 (units digit is 0)\n* 668 numbers with units digit 9: 668*9 = 6022 (units digit is 2)\n* 668 numbers with units digit 1: 668*1 = 668 (units digit is 8)\n\nAdding up the units digits, we get: 7 + 2 + 0 + 2 + 8 = 19\n\nSo, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is 9.\n\nAnswer: $\boxed{9}.$

Correct answer: The units digit of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. The units digit of the square of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 9, or 5: $1^2=1$, $3^2=9$, $5^2=25$, $7^2=49$, $9^2=81$. Of every five consecutive odd, positive integers, exactly 2 end in 1 or 9, exactly 2 end in 3 or 7, and exactly 1 ends in 5. Therefore, of the squares of the first $2005=5\cdot401$ odd, positive integers, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 1, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 9, and exactly $\frac{1}{5}\cdot2005=401$ end in 5. The remaining two squares end in 1 ($1^2$) and 9 ($3^2$), respectively. Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is the units digit of the sum $802\cdot1+802\cdot9+401\cdot5+1+9$, which is $ \boxed{5}$, the units digit of $2+8+5+0=15$.


Question: Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a King and the second card is a $\heartsuit$?

Wrong answer: 1. The probability of the first card being a King:

There are 4 Kings in a standard deck of 52 cards (one in each suit). So, the probability of the first card being a King is:

P(King) = Number of Kings / Total number of cards\n= 4/52\n= 1/13

2. The probability of the second card being a $\\heartsuit$ given that the first card is a King:

Since the first card is a King, there are 51 cards left in the deck. Among these, there are 13 cards of the $\\heartsuit$ suit (including the King of $\\heartsuit$ which has already been removed).

So, the probability of the second card being a $\\heartsuit$ given that the first card is a King is:

P($\\heartsuit$ | King) = Number of $\\heartsuit$ cards left / Total number of cards left\n= 13/51

3. The probability of both events occurring:

Since the events are dependent (the second event depends on the first), we multiply the probabilities:

P(King and $\\heartsuit$) = P(King) × P($\\heartsuit$ | King)\n= (1/13) × (13/51)\n= 1/51

So, the probability that the first card is a King and the second card is a $\\heartsuit$ is 1/51.

Answer: 0.0196 (or 1/51 as a fraction)

Correct answer: We have two cases because if the first card is a King, it could be a $\heartsuit$ or not be a $\heartsuit$.
There is a $\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the King of $\heartsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{12}{51} = \dfrac{4}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the twelve remaining $\heartsuit$, which gives a probability of $\dfrac{1}{52} \times \dfrac{4}{17} = \dfrac{1}{221}$ chance that this occurs.
There is a $\dfrac{3}{52}$ chance that a non-$\heartsuit$ King is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{13}{51}$ chance that a $\heartsuit$ is drawn second, giving a $\dfrac{3}{52} \times \dfrac{13}{51} = \dfrac{1}{68}$ chance that this occurs.
So the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\dfrac{1}{221} + \dfrac{1}{68} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{52}}$.


Question: Find all the solutions to
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} = 4 \sqrt[3]{x}.\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.

Wrong answer: Let's solve the equation step by step.\n\n\\[\\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \\sqrt[3]{13x + 1} = 4 \\sqrt[3]{x}\\]\n\nFirst, let's cube both sides of the equation to eliminate the cube roots:\n\n\\[(\\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \\sqrt[3]{13x + 1})^3 = (4 \\sqrt[3]{x})^3\\]\n\nExpanding the left-hand side using the cube of a sum formula:\n\n\\[(a + b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^3\\]\n\nwe get:\n\n\\[(15x - 1) + 3\\sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)^2}\\sqrt[3]{13x + 1} + 3\\sqrt[3]{15x - 1}(\\sqrt[3]{13x + 1})^2 + (13x + 1) = 64x\\]\n\nNow, let's simplify the equation:\n\n\\[28x - 2 + 3\\sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)^2(13x + 1)} + 3\\sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)^2} = 64x\\]\n\nSubtract 28x from both sides:\n\n\\[-2 + 3\\sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)^2(13x + 1)} + 3\\sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)^2} = 36x\\]\n\nNow, let's assume that the expression inside the cube roots is a perfect cube. This means that:\n\n\\[(15x - 1)^2(13x + 1) = a^3\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[(15x - 1)(13x + 1)^2 = b^3\\]\n\nfor some integers a and b.\n\nThen, the equation becomes:\n\n\\[-2 + 3a + 3b = 36x\\]\n\nSubtract 3a and 3b from both sides:\n\n\\[-2 - 3a - 3b = 36x - 3a - 3b\\]\n\nNow, we can see that the left-hand side is an integer, and the right-hand side is a multiple of 36. This means that:\n\n\\[36x - 3a - 3b = 0\\]\n\nDivide by 36:\n\n\\[x - \\frac{a}{12} - \\frac{b}{12} = 0\\]\n\nNow, we can see that x must be an integer. Let's try some values of x.\n\nFor x = 1, we get:\n\n\\[(15 - 1)^2(13 + 1) = 196^3\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[(15 - 1)(13 + 1)^2 = 196^3\\]\n\nwhich is true.\n\nFor x = 2, we get:\n\n\\[(30 - 1)^2(26 + 1) = 841^3\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[(30 - 1)(26 + 1)^2 = 841^3\\]\n\nwhich is also true.\n\nHowever, for x = 3, we get:\n\n\\[(45 - 1)^2(39 + 1) = 1681^3\\]\n\nand\n\n\\[(45 - 1)(39 + 1)^2 = 1681^3\\]\n\nwhich is not true.\n\nTherefore, the solutions are x = 1 and x = 2.\n\nFinal answer: 1, 2

Correct answer: From the given equation,
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} - 4 \sqrt[3]{x} = 0.\]We can also write this as
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} + \sqrt[3]{-64x} = 0.\]Let $a = \sqrt[3]{15x - 1},$ $b = \sqrt[3]{13x + 1},$ and $c = \sqrt[3]{-64x},$ so $a + b + c = 0.$  From the factorization
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ab - bc),\]we have that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc.$  Hence,
\[-36x = 3 \sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)(-64x)}.\]We can simplify this to
\[3x = \sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)x}.\]Cubing both sides we, get $27x^3 = 195x^3 + 2x^2 - x,$ so $168x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0.$  This factors as $x(14x - 1)(12x + 1) = 0,$ so the solutions are $\boxed{0, \frac{1}{14}, -\frac{1}{12}}.$


Question: The number $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30. If you divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. What is the value of $n$?

Wrong answer: Since $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30, we know that $n$ is an integer greater than 20 and less than 30.\n\nThe problem states that when we divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. This means that we can write $n$ in the form:\n\n$$n = 8k + 5$$\n\nwhere $k$ is an integer.\n\nSince $n$ is between 20 and 30, we know that $k$ must be such that:\n\n$$20 < 8k + 5 < 30$$\n\nSubtracting 5 from all parts of the inequality, we get:\n\n$$15 < 8k < 25$$\n\nDividing all parts of the inequality by 8, we get:\n\n$$1.875 < k < 3.125$$\n\nSince $k$ must be an integer, the only possible value of $k$ is:\n\n$$k = 2$$\n\nSubstituting this value of $k$ back into the equation $n = 8k + 5$, we get:\n\n$$n = 8(2) + 5 = 21$$\n\nTherefore, the value of $n$ is:\n\n$$\\boxed{21}$$

Correct answer: We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\boxed{29}$.

OR

When we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.

Correct answer: We can write
\begin{align*}
\tan 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ &= \frac{\sin 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} + 4 \sin 20^\circ \\
&= \frac{\sin 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.
\end{align*}By double angle formula,
\[\frac{\sin 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.\]Then by sum-to-product,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} &= \frac{\sin 20^\circ + \sin 40^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin 30^\circ \cos 10^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos 10^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos 10^\circ + \cos 50^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.
\end{align*}Again by sum-to-product,
\[\frac{\cos 10^\circ + \cos 50^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = \frac{2 \cos 30^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = 2 \cos 30^\circ = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}.\]""",

Question: A set contains four numbers. The six pairwise sums of distinct elements of the set, in no particular order, are $189$, $320$, $287$, $234$, $x$, and $y$. Find the greatest possible value of $x+y$.

Answer: For such a set $\{a, b, c, d\},$ the six pairwise sums can be themselves paired up into three pairs which all have the same sum: \[\begin{aligned} a+b\; &\text{ with } \;c+d, \\  a+c\; &\text{ with }\; b+d, \\  a+d \;&\text{ with } \;b+c. \end{aligned}\]Thus, the sum of all six pairwise sums is $3S,$ where $S = a+b+c+d,$ and so in our case, \[x+y=3S - (189 + 320 + 287 + 234) = 3S - 1030.\]Therefore, we want to maximize $S.$
Because of the pairing of the six pairwise sums, $S$ must be the sum of two of the four given numbers $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ and $234,$ so the greatest possible value of $S$ is $320 + 287 = 607.$ Therefore, the greatest possible value of $x+y$ is $3(607) - 1030 = 791.$ This value is achievable for the set $\{51.5, 137.5, 182.5, 235.5\},$ which has pairwise sums $189,$ $320,$ $287,$ $234,$ $373,$ and $418.$ Therefore the answer is $\boxed{791}.$


Question: In right $\Delta ABC$, $\angle CAB$ is a right angle. Point $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$. What is the number of centimeters in the length of median $\overline{AM}$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy] pair A,B,C,M;
A = (0,0); B = (4,0); C = (0,3); M = (B+C)/2;
draw(M--A--B--C--A);
label("$A$",A,W); label("$B$",B,E);
label("$C$",C,W); label("$M$",M,NE);
label("3 cm",A--C,W); label("4 cm",A--B,S);
[/asy]

Answer: The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the hypotenuse.  The hypotenuse of $\triangle ABC$ is $\sqrt{3^2+4^2} = 5$, so $AM = BC/2 = \boxed{2.5}$.


Question: An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$

Answer: In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$


Question: What is the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers?

Answer: The units digit of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. The units digit of the square of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 9, or 5: $1^2=1$, $3^2=9$, $5^2=25$, $7^2=49$, $9^2=81$. Of every five consecutive odd, positive integers, exactly 2 end in 1 or 9, exactly 2 end in 3 or 7, and exactly 1 ends in 5. Therefore, of the squares of the first $2005=5\cdot401$ odd, positive integers, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 1, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 9, and exactly $\frac{1}{5}\cdot2005=401$ end in 5. The remaining two squares end in 1 ($1^2$) and 9 ($3^2$), respectively. Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is the units digit of the sum $802\cdot1+802\cdot9+401\cdot5+1+9$, which is $ \boxed{5}$, the units digit of $2+8+5+0=15$.


Question: Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a King and the second card is a $\heartsuit$?

Answer: We have two cases because if the first card is a King, it could be a $\heartsuit$ or not be a $\heartsuit$.
There is a $\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the King of $\heartsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{12}{51} = \dfrac{4}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the twelve remaining $\heartsuit$, which gives a probability of $\dfrac{1}{52} \times \dfrac{4}{17} = \dfrac{1}{221}$ chance that this occurs.
There is a $\dfrac{3}{52}$ chance that a non-$\heartsuit$ King is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{13}{51}$ chance that a $\heartsuit$ is drawn second, giving a $\dfrac{3}{52} \times \dfrac{13}{51} = \dfrac{1}{68}$ chance that this occurs.
So the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\dfrac{1}{221} + \dfrac{1}{68} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{52}}$.


Question: Find all the solutions to
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} = 4 \sqrt[3]{x}.\]Enter all the solutions, separated by commas.

Answer: From the given equation,
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} - 4 \sqrt[3]{x} = 0.\]We can also write this as
\[\sqrt[3]{15x - 1} + \sqrt[3]{13x + 1} + \sqrt[3]{-64x} = 0.\]Let $a = \sqrt[3]{15x - 1},$ $b = \sqrt[3]{13x + 1},$ and $c = \sqrt[3]{-64x},$ so $a + b + c = 0.$  From the factorization
\[a^3 + b^3 + c^3 - 3abc = (a + b + c)(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 - ab - ab - bc),\]we have that $a^3 + b^3 + c^3 = 3abc.$  Hence,
\[-36x = 3 \sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)(-64x)}.\]We can simplify this to
\[3x = \sqrt[3]{(15x - 1)(13x + 1)x}.\]Cubing both sides we, get $27x^3 = 195x^3 + 2x^2 - x,$ so $168x^3 + 2x^2 - x = 0.$  This factors as $x(14x - 1)(12x + 1) = 0,$ so the solutions are $\boxed{0, \frac{1}{14}, -\frac{1}{12}}.$


Question: The number $n$ is a prime number between 20 and 30. If you divide $n$ by 8, the remainder is 5. What is the value of $n$?

Answer: We look at multiples of 8 greater than 15 and less than 25 (since adding 5 should make the number between 20 and 30). So the multiples of 8 that we consider are 16 and 24. Adding 5, we get 21 and 29. Only 29 is a prime number so $n=\boxed{29}$.

OR

When we divide 20 by 8, we get a remainder of 4. That means 21 will have a remainder of 5. The next number with a remainder of 5 would be $21+8=29$. When we consider 21 and 29, $\boxed{29}$ is the prime number.


Question: Compute $\tan 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ.$

Answer: We can write
\begin{align*}
\tan 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ &= \frac{\sin 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} + 4 \sin 20^\circ \\
&= \frac{\sin 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.
\end{align*}By double angle formula,
\[\frac{\sin 20^\circ + 4 \sin 20^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = \frac{\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.\]Then by sum-to-product,
\begin{align*}
\frac{\sin 20^\circ + 2 \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} &= \frac{\sin 20^\circ + \sin 40^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{2 \sin 30^\circ \cos 10^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos 10^\circ + \sin 40^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} \\
&= \frac{\cos 10^\circ + \cos 50^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ}.
\end{align*}Again by sum-to-product,
\[\frac{\cos 10^\circ + \cos 50^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = \frac{2 \cos 30^\circ \cos 20^\circ}{\cos 20^\circ} = 2 \cos 30^\circ = \boxed{\sqrt{3}}.\]


Question: Find the largest constant $C$ so that
\[x^2 + y^2 + 1 \ge C(x + y)\]for all real numbers $x$ and $y.$

Answer: The given inequality expands as
\[x^2 + y^2 + 1 \ge Cx + Cy.\]Completing the square in $x$ and $y,$ we get
\[\left( x - \frac{C}{2} \right)^2 + \left( y - \frac{C}{2} \right)^2 + 1 - \frac{C^2}{2} \ge 0.\]This inequality holds for all $x$ and $y$ if and only if $1 - \frac{C^2}{2} \ge 0,$ or $C^2 \le 2.$  Thus, the largest possible value of $C$ is $\boxed{\sqrt{2}}.$


Question: If $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$, $e$, and $f$ are integers for which  $1000x^3+27= (ax^2 + bx +c )(d x^2 +ex + f)$ for all $x$, then what is $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2+f^2$?

Answer: Apply the sum of cubes factorization to the expression $1000x^3+27 = (10x)^3+3^3$ to obtain  \[
1000x^3+27 = (10x+3)(100x^2-30x+9).
\]Thus $a^2+b^2+c^2+d^2+e^2+f^2=0^2+10^2+3^2+100^2+(-30)^2+9^2=\boxed{11,\!090}$. Note that the fundamental theorem of algebra implies that the factorization we have given is unique, since the discriminant $(-30)^2-4(100)(9)$ of the quadratic $100x^2-30x+9$ is negative.


Question: In right $\Delta ABC$, $\angle CAB$ is a right angle. Point $M$ is the midpoint of $\overline{BC}$. What is the number of centimeters in the length of median $\overline{AM}$? Express your answer as a decimal to the nearest tenth. [asy] pair A,B,C,M;
A = (0,0); B = (4,0); C = (0,3); M = (B+C)/2;
draw(M--A--B--C--A);
label("$A$",A,W); label("$B$",B,E);
label("$C$",C,W); label("$M$",M,NE);
label("3 cm",A--C,W); label("4 cm",A--B,S);
[/asy]

Answer: The length of the median to the hypotenuse of a right triangle is half the hypotenuse.  The hypotenuse of $\triangle ABC$ is $\sqrt{3^2+4^2} = 5$, so $AM = BC/2 = \boxed{2.5}$.


Question: An ellipse is defined parametrically by
\[(x,y) = \left( \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t}, \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t} \right).\]Then the equation of the ellipse can be written in the form
\[Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0,\]where $A,$ $B,$ $C,$ $D,$ $E,$ and $F$ are integers, and $\gcd(|A|,|B|,|C|,|D|,|E|,|F|) = 1.$  Find $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F|.$

Answer: In the equation $y = \frac{3 (\cos t - 5)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\cos t$ to get
\[\cos t = \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3}.\]In the equation $x = \frac{2 (\sin t - 1)}{2 - \cos t},$ we can solve for $\sin t$ to get
\[\sin t = \frac{1}{2} x (2 - \cos t) + 1 = \frac{1}{2} x \left( 2 - \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right) + 1 = 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)}.\]Since $\cos^2 t + \sin^2 t = 1,$
\[\left( \frac{2y + 15}{y + 3} \right)^2 + \left( 1 - \frac{9x}{2(y + 3)} \right)^2 = 1.\]Multiplying both sides by $(2(y + 3))^2$ and expanding, it will simplify to
\[81x^2 - 36xy + 16y^2 - 108x + 240y + 900 = 0.\]Therefore, $|A| + |B| + |C| + |D| + |E| + |F| = 81 + 36 + 16 + 108 + 240 + 900 = \boxed{1381}.$


Question: What is the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers?

Answer: The units digit of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. The units digit of the square of an odd, positive integer can only be 1, 9, or 5: $1^2=1$, $3^2=9$, $5^2=25$, $7^2=49$, $9^2=81$. Of every five consecutive odd, positive integers, exactly 2 end in 1 or 9, exactly 2 end in 3 or 7, and exactly 1 ends in 5. Therefore, of the squares of the first $2005=5\cdot401$ odd, positive integers, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 1, exactly $\frac{2}{5}\cdot2005=802$ end in 9, and exactly $\frac{1}{5}\cdot2005=401$ end in 5. The remaining two squares end in 1 ($1^2$) and 9 ($3^2$), respectively. Therefore, the units digit of the sum of the squares of the first 2007 odd, positive integers is the units digit of the sum $802\cdot1+802\cdot9+401\cdot5+1+9$, which is $ \boxed{5}$, the units digit of $2+8+5+0=15$.


Question: Two cards are dealt at random from a standard deck of 52 cards.  What is the probability that the first card is a King and the second card is a $\heartsuit$?

Answer: We have two cases because if the first card is a King, it could be a $\heartsuit$ or not be a $\heartsuit$.

There is a $\dfrac{1}{52}$ chance that the King of $\heartsuit$ is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{12}{51} = \dfrac{4}{17}$ chance that the second card drawn is one of the twelve remaining $\heartsuit$, which gives a probability of $\dfrac{1}{52} \times \dfrac{4}{17} = \dfrac{1}{221}$ chance that this occurs.

There is a $\dfrac{3}{52}$ chance that a non-$\heartsuit$ King is drawn first, and a $\dfrac{13}{51}$ chance that a $\heartsuit$ is drawn second, giving a $\dfrac{3}{52} \times \dfrac{13}{51} = \dfrac{1}{68}$ chance that this occurs.

So the probability that one of these two cases happens is $\dfrac{1}{221} + \dfrac{1}{68} = \boxed{\dfrac{1}{52}}$.""",
